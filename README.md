## ✨ Overview  

Machine learning pipelines simplify the process of preprocessing, training, and reusing models. This project showcases:  

- ✅ Automated data preprocessing (handling missing data, scaling, and encoding).  
- ✅ Model training and evaluation.  
- ✅ Exporting and importing pipelines for seamless reuse.

## 📊 Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is `accident.csv` and contains the following columns:  

- 🧑‍🦳 **Age**: Age of the individual.  
- 🚻 **Gender**: Gender of the individual.  
- 🚗 **Speed_of_Impact**: Speed at the time of the accident.  
- 🪖 **Helmet_Used**: Indicates if a helmet was used (Yes/No).  
- 🛡️ **Seatbelt_Used**: Indicates if a seatbelt was used (Yes/No).  
- 💔 **Survived**: Survival status (1 for survived, 0 for not survived).
